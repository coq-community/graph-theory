- pass on transfer / open_confluence
- documentation + spell-checking
- some light-blue background for text boxes?

-----

- solve rewriting/setoid_rewriting/Type/irewrite... (or at least uniformise)

- get completeness for 2p algebra axioms by extending the rewrite system

- use packed classes for getting a more fine-grain presentation of the structures we employ,
  without running into efficiency problems
  . for multigraphs and 2-pointed multigraphs (which inherit finType)
  . for setoids, labels, pttdom, ptt and related structures

- conservativity proof of 2p over 2pdom

- simpler term extraction via the rewrite system? (requires expansion)
