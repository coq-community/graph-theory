(** * Rewrite System for 2p-graphs (additive presentation) *)

(** In this file we define a rewrite system for reducing 2p-graphs
labeled with elements of a 2pdom algebra.  *)


(** note: 
- we need everything to be finite to get a terminating rewrite system
- elsewhere we don't care that the edge type is a finType, it could certainly just be a Type
- the vertex type has to be an eqType at various places since we regularly compare vertices (e.g., [add_vlabel])
- the vertex type has to be a finType for the [merge] operation, but only in order to express the new vertex labeling function... we could imagine a [finitary_merge] operation that would not impose this restriction
- the vertex type has to be finite also when we go to open graphs (although maybe countable would suffice) *)
