- extraction via [merge_subgraph_par] lemma

- uniformise handling of bijections/isomorphisms and equality lemmas

- solve rewriting/setoid_rewriting/Type/irewrite... (or at least uniformise)

- get completeness for 2p algebra axioms by extending the rewrite system

- use packed classes for getting a more fine-grain presentation of the structures we employ,
  without running into efficiency problems
  . for multigraphs and 2-pointed multigraphs (which inherit finType)
  . for setoids, labels, pttdom, ptt and related structures

- conservativity proof of 2p over 2pdom

- simpler term extraction via the rewrite system? (requires expansion)
